## Installation

1. Install `jupyterlab`:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

2. Open notebooks by:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Alternatively, you can start JupyterLab by:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

3. Each example has its own `requirements.txt` file which will be used to install the required packages.
