# Path Signatures for Human Action Recognition using Esig
[jhmdb_demo.ipynb](jhmdb_demo.ipynb) is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook which demonstrates the use of path signatures obtained using esig for human action recognition. The analysis is closely related to the work of [Yang et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03993). The notebook is partially viewable directly from gitlab, however Jupyter or Binder are recommended for viewing the example videos included in the notebook.

## How to Run
The notebook attempts to install the packages listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) automatically when executed.

Alternatively, a typical process for installing the package dependencies involves creating a new Python virtual environment and then inside the environment executing

    pip install -r requirements.txt -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
