# Using Path Signatures for Anomaly Detection in Natural Language Processing

[alphabet_analysis.ipynb](alphabet_analysis.ipynb) is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook which demonstrates the use of path signatures for anomaly detection in natural language processing. 

Note that the data is pre-processed in [language_dataset_anomalies_data.ipynb](language_dataset_anomalies_data.ipynb) and we train a character-level RoBERTa model in [train_english_char_bert.ipynb](train_english_char_bert.ipynb). 

## How to Run

A typical process for installing the package dependencies involves creating a new Python virtual environment and then inside the environment executing

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
