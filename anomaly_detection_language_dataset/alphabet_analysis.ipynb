    "# Anomaly Detection task\n",
    "\n",
    "In natural language processing (NLP) tasks, we often are dealing with high dimensional streams of data. Neural network architectures known as Transformers have been shown to be very effective in NLP tasks, and we can use these to obtain high dimensional streams of embeddings for words/tokenised text. In this notebook, we will look at how we can use path signature techniques to analyse these high dimensional streams of embeddings. In particular, we will look at how we can perform outlier detection on the path signatures of the embeddings obtained from a pre-trained Transformer. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we consider the task of determining whether a word is an english word or not by using the path signature of the stream of _character_ embeddings of the word. That is, each word is represented as a stream of character embeddings. We do this by training a Transformer model (from scratch) on a _masked language modelling_ task (or _Cloze_ task) as described in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) using a corpus of english words, and then use this model to obtain a stream of (character) embeddings for a sample of (english and non-english) words. Path signature techniques are applied to analyse the streams of embeddings and finally we attempt to detect the non-english words as outliers in the space of path signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are dealing with high dimensional streams of data, we will use a dimension reduction technique to reduce the dimension of the embeddings before computing the path signature. We will look at how we can perform outlier detection on the path signatures of the dimension-reduced embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline for this task is as follows:\n",
    "1. Train a Transformer model on a masked language modelling task using a corpus of english words.\n",
    "2. Obtain a stream of character embeddings for a sample of english and non-english words using the trained model (note that we ensure that the english words in this sample are not in the training corpus to pre-train the Transformer).\n",
    "    - The english words in this sample are our _inlier_ class while the non-english words are our _outlier_ class in this example.\n",
    "3. Perform dimension reduction on the streams of embeddings.\n",
    "4. Compute the path signature of the dimension-reduced embeddings.\n",
    "5. Perform outlier detection on the path signatures to detect the non-english words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we illustrate how we can use the [`nlpsig`](https://github.com/datasig-ac-uk/nlpsig) package to utilise transformers in order to obtain streams of high dimensional embeddings, which can then be analysed using path signature techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we utilise the [`signature_mahalanobis_knn`](https://github.com/datasig-ac-uk/signature_mahalanobis_knn) library to perform outlier detection on the path signatures. Full details of our approach can be found in [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03487) _Dimensionless Anomaly Detection on Multivariate Streams with Variance Norm and Path Signature_ by Zhen Shao, Ryan Sze-Yin Chan, Thomas Cochrane, Peter Foster, Terry Lyons."

A few ways are by using the [`nlpsig.TextEncoder.obtain_embeddings`](https://nlpsig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/encode_text.html#nlpsig.encode_text.TextEncoder.obtain_embeddings) method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Returning the output of a particular hidden layer\n",
    "    - use `.obtain_embeddings(method = \"hidden_layer\", layers = l)` where `l` is the layer you want\n",

    "- Concatenate the output of several hidden layers\n",
    "    - use `.obtain_embeddings(method = \"concatenate\", layers = [l_1, l_2, ...])` where `[l_1, l_2, ...]` is a list of layers you want to concatenate\n",
    "- Element-wise sum the output of several hidden layers\n",
    "    - use `.obtain_embeddings(method = \"sum\" , layers = [l_1, l_2, ...])` where `[l_1, l_2, ...]` is a list of layers you want to sum\n",

The above methods would return a 2-dimensional array with dimensions `[token, embedding]`.\n",

    "We can construct a path by using the [`nlpsig.PrepareData.pad`](https://nlpsig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_preparation.html#nlpsig.data_preparation.PrepareData.pad) method, and result of this is a multi-dimensional array or tensor (in particular a numpy array or PyTorch tensor) which can be then used in some downstream task. It is called \"pad\" because arrays and tensors are rectangular and if there are cases where there isn't enough data (e.g. if a word only has 3 letters/tokens and we want to make paths of length 4), we \"pad\" with either the last token embedding (if we set `zero_padding=False`) or with a vector of zeros (if we set `zero_padding=True`).\n",

There is an alternative option to construct a path by looking at the history of a particular embedding (i.e. the stream embeddings that occurred before), but this is not useful here in this context, and we will cover that in another notebook."

    "## Obtaining path signatures for the corpus, inliers and outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have obtained our paths for our corpus, the inliers and the outliers, we can obtain the path signatures for each of these. In this notebook, we use [RoughPy](https://roughpy.org/) developed by Sam Morley, Terry Lyons et al. to compute path signatures. Before we compute our path signatures, it is often useful to normalise the channels of the paths. For this example, we will use min-max scaling to normalise the channels of the paths. We compute the minimum and maximum using the corpus paths (our training data) and then use these to normalise the paths for the inliers and outliers (our test data)."

    "- We trained a language model using a corpus of english words stored in the `english_train` dataframe.\n",
    "- We have another set of english words (inliers) and some non-english words (outliers) which are stored in the `corpus_sample_df` dataframe.\n",
    "- We now want to see how we could detect the non-english words efficiently, in particular, we use the following method:\n",
    "    - For each word in `english_train` and `corpus_sample_df`, we have a vector representation for them (e.g. we've computed the path signatures for each of them and they are stored in `english_word_sig`).\n",
    "    - For each word in `corpus_sample_df`, we compute the minimum Mahalanobis distance between its path signature to path signatures for our corpus of known English words (i.e. each row in `english_word_sig`).\n",
    "    - We then look the [ROC curve](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_curve.html) to see how well separated are the english words to the non-english words. For a good performance, we hope that there is good separation, and so we measure the success of this method using the [ROCAUC](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html).\n",

    "Full details of the anomaly detection methodology can be found in [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03487) _Dimensionless Anomaly Detection on Multivariate Streams with Variance Norm and Path Signature_ by Zhen Shao, Ryan Sze-Yin Chan, Thomas Cochrane, Peter Foster, Terry Lyons. Implementation of this approach can be found in the [`signature_mahalanobis_knn`](https://github.com/datasig-ac-uk/signature_mahalanobis_knn) library.\n",

    "Note that in Section 5.2.4 of [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03487), we consider the same language dataset example as we do here, but use one-hot encoding vector representations for the characters. We will see our dimension reduced transformer embeddings give us a boost in performance as seen in the paper.\n",

    "**Warning**: in this notebook, we will use all CPU cores available to fit the model, so you may want to change that in the next cell. Fiting may take a while to run - when developing this notebook, we used a Apple M1 Pro chip with 10 CPU cores and 32GB of RAM and took around 4 hours to fit. Inference afterwards is much quicker. If you have a less powerful machine, or just want to run this quicker, you can reduce the corpus size by taking a sample of the corpus signatures to fit the model on. "
