    "More specifically, we will use the Python package [esig](https://esig.readthedocs.io/) to compute the path signatures of simulated radio waves reflected off the surface of drone and non-drone objects. Our mathematical model of a drone consists of a slowly moving body and a single, rapidly moving propeller. Relative to an observer who emits radio pulses and receives their reflections, owing to propagation time delay and Doppler shift we expect that the signal characteristics of radio pulses reflected off the drone's propeller differ from the signal characteristics of radio pulses reflected off the drone's body.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will attempt to distinguish between drone and non-drone objects, where we assume that when we reflect a radio pulse off drones, the reflected signal received back by the observer is the combination of the reflection caused by the drone's body and the reflection caused by the drone's propeller. Our non-drone model consists of a slowly moving body (identical to the one used in the drone), omitting the propeller present in the drone model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core mathematical object that we will use to construct our features is a sequence of iterated integrals, known as the path signature. We compute path signatures up to a specified truncation level, which yields a low-dimensional representation of the $N$-dimensional path $X:[a, b]\\to \\mathbb{R}^N$. We will construct piecewise linear paths from  pairs of successively observed reflected radio pulses by stacking their time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, we will estimate **expected path signatures** by averaging path signatures obtained for several thousand simulated radio pulses reflected off drone objects with varying propeller locations. The approach of using expected path signatures aims at characterising random behaviour in reflected signals. Taking estimates of expected path signatures as our feature vectors, we will consider the task of distinguishing between drone and non-drone objects, in addition to predicting the number of rotations per minute (RPM) of the drone's propeller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the principal aim of this notebook is to demonstrate the use of path signatures qualitatively and from a practical perspective, using $\\texttt{esig}$. A more detailed analysis might involve quantifying predictive accuracy using a broader range of parameters and evaluating the effect of adding noise to the signals, in addition multi-path propagation."

    "Our incident signal is an electromagnetic sine wave comprising $1000$ wavelengths. The sine wave has frequency $\\mathcal{f}=1$GHz, thus its wavelength is approximately $30$cm. When the incident signal hits either of the two moving objects, it reflects off them. The reflected signal is a linear combination of the reflections produced by the drone's body and the drone's propeller. For the purpose of this notebook we will consider a pulse rate of $3$kHz. An observer positioned at a fixed location emits the incident signals and observes the reflected signals.\n",

We assume a propeller with diameter $d$, and further assume that each individual point on the propeller is a tiny perfect mirror perpendicular to the observer and moving at constant velocity relative to the observer. The speed of the propeller acting as a mirror varies according to the distance along the propeller blade and further depends on the number of rotations per minute (RPM), as well as the propeller's angle when the reflection occurs. We also assume that the entire signal hits the same 'tiny mirror'. That is, the mirror's speed and position remain constant for the duration of the reflection; the mirror does not change direction and thus does not accelerate. We assume that the observer generates $3000$ incident signals which consequently undergo reflection by the drone's body and propeller. These reflected signals are subsequently received back by the observer for analysis.\n",

In our case, we will construct a 3-dimensional path for the pair of successively reflected signals that the observer receives for each pair of successively emitted pulses.

Based on estimating expected path signatures up to level $K=2$ from pairs reflected signals, results suggest that path signature features are an informative low-dimensional representation for the considered task."
