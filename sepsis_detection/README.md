# Path Signatures for Early Sepsis Detection
[sepsis_detection.ipynb](sepsis_detection.ipynb) is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook which demonstrates the use of path signatures for sepsis detection. The analysis is based on the winning entry by Morrill et al. of the [PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/).
