# Path Signatures for Early Sepsis Detection

[sepsis_detection.ipynb](sepsis_detection.ipynb) is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook which demonstrates the use of path signatures for sepsis detection. The analysis is based on the work of Ni et al. (2021). This work builds on the winning approach by Morrill et al. of the [PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/), by building a [real-time sepsis analysis pipeline](https://github.com/HangL-39/Mimiciii_Sepsis_Label_Extraction) to train and evaluate a suite of representative models against the MIMIC III dataset.
