# Path Signatures for Natural Language Processing using Esig
[nlp_demo.ipynb](nlp_demo.ipynb) is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook which demonstrates the use of path signatures obtained using esig for natural language processing. The notebook is viewable directly from github, however Jupyter is recommended for best results.

## How to Run
A typical process for installing the package dependencies involves creating a new Python virtual environment and then inside the environment executing

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then install PyTorch manually following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
Alternatively (not recommended), you can try running

    pip install -r requirements_torch.txt
