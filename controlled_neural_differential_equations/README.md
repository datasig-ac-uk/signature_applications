# Path Signatures for Controlled Neural Differential Equations
[logsignature.ipynb](logsignature.ipynb) and [time_series_classification.ipynb](time_series_classification.ipynb) are [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks which demonstrate the use of controlled neural differential equations.
The notebook is viewable directly from GitHub, however Jupyter is recommendedfor best results when rendering mathematical notation.

## Getting started

First install Poetry according to instructions at: https://python-poetry.org/docs/

```bash
poetry install

jupyter notebook logsignature.ipynb

# or

jupyter notebook time_series_classification.ipynb
```


## Dependencies

This notebook's dependencies are listed in the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file.
