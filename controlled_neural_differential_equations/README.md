# Path Signatures for Controlled Neural Differential Equations
[logsignature.ipynb](logsignature.ipynb) and [time_series_classification.ipynb](time_series_classification.ipynb) are [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks which demonstrate the use of controlled neural differential equations. The notebook is viewable directly from gitlab, however Jupyter is recommendedfor best results when rendering mathematical notation.

## How to Run
The notebook attempts to install the packages listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) automatically when executed. A typical process involves first creating a new Python virtual environment and then inside the environment executing the notebook.
