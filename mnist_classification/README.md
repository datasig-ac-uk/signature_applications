# Path Signatures for Handwritten Digit Classification using Esig
[handwritten_digit_classification.ipynb](handwritten_digit_classification.ipynb) is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook which demonstrates the use of path signatures obtained using [esig](https://esig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for handwritten digit classification. The notebook is viewable directly from gitlab, however Jupyter is recommendedfor best results when rendering mathematical notation.

## How to Run
The notebook attempts to install the packages listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) automatically when executed. A typical process involves first creating a new Python virtual environment and then inside the environment executing the notebook.
